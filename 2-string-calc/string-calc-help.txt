String Calculator Instructions
==============================

Create a simple String calculator
	with a method "int Add(string numbers)".

The method can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers,
	and will return their sum
	(for an empty string it will return 0), for example "" or "1" or "1,2".
	
Start with the simplest test (empty string)
	and move to 1 and 2 numbers.
	
Solve things as simply as possible,
	so that you force yourself
	to write tests you did not think about.
	
Refactor after each passing test.
